                   <p> AMD is on the rise to bury their longest rival Intel in their upcoming Ryzen CPU chips that could come in octa core and hexa core and unlocked. See full details here for the clockspeed, pricing as well as the new release date that is slated between February 27th and March 3rd.
                    According to AMD these new processors will be more centered around inprovements in the single core computing power rather than just a race for core count, as they have done in the past.

                    <h2 class="text-center">AMD Ryzen release dates</h2>
                    <p>AMD has reportedly leaked the release date of Ryzen 4 cores CPU but there is no specific date mentioned. According to <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/11031/amd-set-to-launch-ryzen-before-march-3rd-meeting-q1-target" target="_blank"> AnandTech</a>, AMD is likely to unveil the most-hyped CPU during the Annual Game Developer Conference to be conducted by AMD Game Engineering Team. 
                    The GDC Event will take place from February 27th and March 3rd and AMD is said to announce Ryzen CPU any day during the entire event. However, another speculation suggests that AMD could announced Ryzen CPU during the MWC which also falls on the same date. </p>

                    <h2 class="text-center">AMD Ryzen Octa Core and Hexa Core Updates</h2>
                    <p> Everyone is already knowledgeable about the upcoming 4 core 8 thread version of AMD Ryzen chips. This time, the company is heading towards a possibility of releasing another version of the chips that could come in octa core and hexa core; however, it could come with an issue regarding the supply, according to Segment Next.
                    <br>
                    Accordingly, the octa core and hexa core version of AMD Ryzen CPU is likely to come unlocked and equipped with TDP less than 95W. But since the PC market is reportedly declining, chances are AMD will be pushing through with the 4 core versions to the masses because higher cores are deemed not                      beneficial when it comes to gaming.<br>
                    
                    However, industries such as workstations and content creators require higher cores CPU, there is possibility that octa core and hexa core AMD Ryzen CPUs could prosper in these kind of niches. Also, if the company could come up with a competitive price point than Intel has to offer, these CPUs have                     higher chances of generating greater sales than competitor.</p>

In addition, AMD exhibited Ryzen processor-based “extreme performance” PC designs from 17 top system integrators across the globe as well as innovative third-party CPU cooler designs, demonstrating a ready and robust ecosystem for Ryzen CPUs.</p>

                    <p>If AMD were to be believed,<br>
                       <em> &quot; AMD has created a processor product and brand in AMD Ryzen™ that expresses the power and efficiency of the all-new high-performance and highly efficient “Zen” x86 core. Multiple architectural advances combined with platform and processing technologies propel users to the next horizon of computing.<br>
                        AMD Ryzen processors will enable the digital creators, VR pioneers, game world explorers, and tech thrill-seekers. Those determined to imagine, code, and conquer without boundaries in the immersive computing era.&quot;</em>
                        <br><br>While the hype is real and the claims are grandiose from both AMD and all the people who got to see it first hand, I'd still tread catiously. AMD has a long history of backtracking on promises and not living up to the hype.
                        But still, from the bottom of my heart, I want AMD to make a comeback. Let's see what to come from AMD.</p>
